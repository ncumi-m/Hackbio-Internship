# Hackbio-Internship - Stage 0 Task
I created nested lists for each category required, e.g. names, slack_names, hobbies...
Each nested list included each group member's details that they provided.
I created an f-string so that I could make the text (txt = f-string) a cohesive sentence that captured everyone's details in an easy to read paragraph.
I then printed the txt and the code ran successfully.
